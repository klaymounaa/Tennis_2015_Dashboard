## 📊 Key Insights

Here are some of the most important insights discovered from the dataset:

1. **Most active ATP players fall between their mid-20s and early-30s**, where tennis performance typically peaks.  
2. **Tournament structure strongly shapes match dynamics**, with Grand Slams showing clear differences due to best-of-5 formats.  
3. **Court surface significantly influences playing style and outcomes**, especially between hard, clay, and grass.  
4. **Serving strength is one of the clearest indicators of match control**, correlating with dominance and win probability.  
5. **Match length drives many performance indicators**, including serve accuracy, break points, and physical decline.
